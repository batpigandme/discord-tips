## Discord support resources

Before we get into tips and tricks of our own, here are some helpful links provided by [Discord Support](https://support.discord.com/) that are worth checking out if you're new to the platform:

-   [Beginner's guide to Discord](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).
-   [Discord basics](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/sections/360008206871-Discord-Basics).

## Why can I only see one channel?

Short answer: You have yet to agree to the Code of Conduct.

### How to fix this

Again, the short answer is to click the âœ… icon in the `#code-of-conduct` channel, but here is a breakdown of what this will look like.

::: il
1.  When you first join the rstudio::conf(2022) Discord, you'll only see one channel, and your name will be in white. So, basically, you're not fully activated.

The content of that channel shows text describing the code of conduct and indicating that you should click the checkbox to agree."}

2.  To agree to the Code of Conduct, you check the green checkbox icon as a reaction to the lone post in that channel.

3.  Once you have agreed to the Code of Conduct, other channels will appear in the sidebar!

## How do I disconnect from a voice channel?

You've connected to a voice channel, and are ready to take your leave. But how?!

::: il
1.  Towards the bottom of the sidebar where the channels names are shown (just above your user name and settings), there's a section showing your voice connection. Go to it.

    ![](imgs/discord-voice-disconnect-1.png){fig-alt="Bottom of Discord's left-hand sidebar with voice-connection box between the list of channels and the user settings options. The voice-connection section shows Voice Connected, the name of the channel, and, on the right, a call-connection icon."}

2.  On the right-hand side of that box there is a call-connection icon (a phone with an 'x' above it). Click on the call-connection icon to disconnect.

    ![](imgs/discord-voice-disconnect-3.png){fig-alt="Voice connection box with call-connection button (a phone with an x above it) zoomed in. The cursor is hovering over the call-connection button, and the tooltip reads Disconnect."}
