But, here is a step-by-step breakdown of what that will look like:\n\n\nWhen you first join the rstudio::conf(2022) Discord, you‚Äôll only see one channel, and your name will be in white. So, basically, you‚Äôre not fully activated.\n\nTo agree to the Code of Conduct, you check the green checkbox icon as a reaction to the lone post in that channel.\n\nOnce you have agreed to the Code of Conduct, other channels will appear in the sidebar!\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to view as animation"
