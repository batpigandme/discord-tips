But, here is a step-by-step breakdown of what that will look like:\n\n\nWhen you first join the rstudio::conf(2022) Discord, you’ll only see one channel, and your name will be in white. So, basically, you’re not fully activated.\n\nTo agree to the Code of Conduct, you check the green checkbox icon as a reaction to the lone post in that channel.\n\nOnce you have agreed to the Code of Conduct, other channels will appear in the sidebar!\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to view as animation"

    "text": "How do I disconnect from a voice channel?\nYou’ve connected to a voice channel, and are ready to take your leave. But how?!\n\n\nTowards the bottom of the sidebar where the channels names are shown (just above your user name and settings), there’s a section showing your voice connection. Go to it.\n\nOn the right-hand side of that box there is a call-connection icon (a phone with an ‘x’ above it). Click on the call-connection icon to disconnect.\n\n\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown with device-specific screenshots, check out How to Leave a Voice Channel in Discord.\n\nBonus tip: Mute yourself\nWant to make sure your conversation with your cat isn’t overheard when you’re in a voice channel? Mute yourself! You can toggle mute by clicking the microphone icon next to your name in the bottom of the left-hand sidebar, or by using the default keyboard shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + M.\n\nJust like with Zoom or *insert your fave video-chat platform here*, voice channels on Discord work better when folks who aren’t speaking are muted, anyhow!"
