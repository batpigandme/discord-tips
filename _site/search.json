So, basically, you’re not fully activated.\n\nTo agree to the Code of Conduct, you check the green checkbox icon as a reaction to the lone post in that channel.\n\nOnce you have agreed to the Code of Conduct, other channels will appear in the sidebar!\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand to view as animation"

But how?!\n\n\nTowards the bottom of the sidebar where the channels names are shown (just above your user name and settings), there’s a section showing your voice connection. Go to it.\n\nOn the right-hand side of that box there is a call-connection icon (a phone with an ‘x’ above it). Click on the call-connection icon to disconnect.\n\n\n\nFor a more detailed breakdown with device-specific screenshots, check out How to Leave a Voice Channel in Discord."
